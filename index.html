      <h3 class="center-text electric-blue">Hello there!</h3>
      <p class="electric-blue">I'm Cassia, an aspiring software engineer from Southern California.  I've worked in sales and in purchasing for several years before I finally deciding to take the plunge into coding!</p>

          <li>Ever inquisitive, I've poked around in the digital world as long as I can remember.</li>
          <li>I've dabbled in various code-adjacent things for over a decade, sometimes leading me to hex editors and and associated text editing.</li>
          <li>I'm always the one asking "have you checked the manual yet?" when someone comes across a problem, be it building furniture or playing a game.</li>

      <h2 class="center-text">About Me</h2>
      <p>I went straight to the workforce after graduating high school, but it never felt quite right.  COVID-19 afforded me an opportunity to test out both HTML and CSS, and this hands-on experience got my gears turning.  I've looked around at a variety of things since, but coding is the only one that has stuck.  Ever a fan of computers and technology, I am now devoting my efforts to properly learning how to code.</p>
      <p>In my free time you'll often find me crafting in Final Fantasy XIV, playing one of the many "souls" and "souls-like" games out there, or building a custom mechanical keyboard.  </p>
